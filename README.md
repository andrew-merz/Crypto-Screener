Welcome to Crypto-Screener!

Crypto Screener is a React-based front-end application used to view real-time information about crypto currencies. Using the Coin Gecko API, users can view trending coins, search for specific coins, and view the coins historical data in a chart format. Users can view detailed information about a coin by searching for it in the search bar and clicking on the coin or by clicking through the pagination feature at the bottom of the homepage.
